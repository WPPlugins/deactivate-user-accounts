Gives you the ability to temporarily disable user accounts without having to delete them.

== Description ==
This tiny plugin gives you the ability to deactivate user accounts quickly and effortlessly. When someone with a deactivated account tries to log in, a friendly error message is displayed on the login screen. You can reactivate the disabled accounts any time you want.

**Usage:**

To start using the plugin visit the default user table in the WordPress interface (Users > All Users), select the user accounts that you want to deactivate, choose 'Deactivate' from the bulk actions dropdown, and finally hit 'Apply'. To reactivate, repeat the same procedure but this time select 'Activate' from the bulk actions dropdown.

**Permissions:**

Only administrators are allowed to use this system. People with lower access levels are neither shown the new bulk actions, nor are they allowed to change the status of accounts.

**Important: To make sure that you don't lock yourself out of the admin area, the plugin does not deactivate the currently logged in user.**
